# Space Wars: Node Edition

## Installation

### Download Node.js

[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on V8, the same engine that is used in Google Chrome. This project uses ecmaScript 6 standards, so you must have **version 6+** of node.js. If you are unsure what version you have, run `node -v` in a command window.

### Clone the Repository

Open a command window to the desired containing folder for the project.

I.E., if you want the project stored in `C:/projects/space-wars...`, you should open a command window to `C:/projects`

Then clone the repository using

```
git clone https://github.com/marcus13345/space-wars-node-edition.git
```

### Install Node Packages

Once the repository has been downloaded, `cd` into the project folder.

To install the Node.js dependencies, run

```
npm install
```

### Run the Program

To run the program, simply execute the following command

```
npm start
```
